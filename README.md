# SC2-AI
This is my attempt to work with Deepminds Starcraft 2 machine learning environment pysc2 to create a reinforcement learning AI.
See https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2 for all the details on the environment.

My ultimate goal would be to createa bot that can play Zerg (my favourite race). The rest of the community seems to be focusing more on the terran race, so this seems like a fun niche to explore.

My first objective will be to get a simple reinforcement learning bot working in the test maps MoveToBeacon and CollectMineralShards.
